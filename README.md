# Battleship

- refactor
  - layer of indirection for moves, to support alternate game modes
    - struct "move" that a player / world consumes?
- play vs computer
  - random ship placement
  - 'smarter' / harder AI
      - doesn't know your ships, but is smarter about where to shoot
- draw text
    - messages for hit/miss log
        - Waiting for your opponent to (place their ships)
        - Waiting for your opponent to (fire)
        - Miss...
        - Hit!
        - sunk ship messages
        - Hit! You sunk their x
            - requires ship names
    - grid labels
    - 'score' - ships remaining, per player
    - help text
    - DONE Place your ships!
    - DONE Take aim
    - DONE choose a library!
    - DONE draw title
- DONE game end (when all ships are sunk)

- local version: play on the same screen against another person
  - hide placement from each other
  - just targeting / hits / misses
  - game mode selector
- design
  - improved colors
  - better text sizing / placement
- internet / local network version
    - see only your ships
    - try to hit the other player
- allow mouse to select
- ship placement
  - allow edit ships after placed
  - allow undo for placing ships
- movement rerendering is... slow somehow?
    - is this waiting on inputs too slowly?
- dumb, don't do, speed things:
    - keep more state, do less compute
      - ship status
      - shot status (hit or miss)
      - overlaps - change data structure?
    - don't redraw the world every time
    - keep a rendered font gpu cache

- Build for windows, mac, web
- web server for:
  - get latest binary
  - find active players to start a game
- nice to have: .bmp's for the ships
- sounds with https://docs.rs/rodio/0.14.0/rodio/ or something

- ship placement / setup
  - DONE move boats with arrow keys
  - DONE confirm with key
  - DONE select which boat to move somehow (iteratively)
  - DONE turn ships
  - DONE prevent ships from locking when they intersect
- DONE ship status (placing, locked, hidden)
- DONE(ish, for now) figure out turn taking
    - DONE move target with arrow keys
    - DONE select with space or enter
    - DONE adds to shots taken
- DONE get grids rendering per player
    - DONE rendering empty grids
    - DONE render ships on grids
- DONE render hits / misses on ships
    - DONE for now: copy other player from this player, effectively shooting at yourself
    - DONE: AI: random move of target
        - DONE don't allow firing again at an existing shot
